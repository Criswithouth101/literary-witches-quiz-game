Name: The Literary Witches: Quiz Edition
Welcome to the Literary Witches Quiz Game — a magical journey through the world of women writers, inspired by the enchanting Literary Witches Oracle Deck. In this interactive browser-based quiz, players must channel their inner witch and correctly answer questions about legendary literary women. Your choices determine your fate: ascend the ranks of the coven or be cast out as a confused human.

Background:
I created this game to celebrate the mystical and intellectual energy of women in literature, combining game mechanics with visual storytelling. The idea draws from the literary witches oracle deck — a favorite of mine — blending mysticism, art, and feminism into one interactive experience.
